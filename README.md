**Microsoft Sentinel SOC Challenge â€” Network (Authentication) Traffic Anomalies**

By Tamim Shamal

Day 9 of the 10-Day Microsoft SOC Challenge

# Overview
This project investigates **Network Traffic Anomalies** using authentication patterns observed in Windows event logs (**SecurityEvent_CL**) within Microsoft Sentinel.
The goal is to detect abnormal network logon behavior, such as repeated failed logons, sudden spikes in authentication attempts, or brute-force-style activity across multiple endpoints.
