**Microsoft Sentinel SOC Challenge â€” Network (Authentication) Traffic Anomalies**

By Tamim Shamal

Day 9 of the 10-Day Microsoft SOC Challenge

# Overview

In this challenge, I investigated **Network Authentication Traffic Anomalies** using Microsoft Sentinel and KQL to detect suspicious patterns in authentication logs (SecurityEvent_CL). The main goal was to identify failed logon spikes, brute-force attempts, and abnormal process activity indicating possible network intrusion.
